Under the violet-hued sky of a distant world, a tiny dragon named Zephyra perched on a tree made of crystal. She gazed at the shimmering rivers below, where fish with golden wings leaped gracefully into the air. The wind carried whispers of forgotten songs, and the scent of lavender mixed with something inexplicably sweet.

Zephyra yawned, her iridescent scales catching the last rays of the setting sun. “Another day, another mystery,” she sighed. Tonight, the stars promised answers—if only she could figure out the right questions to ask.
